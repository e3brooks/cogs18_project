    "Information has become increasingly accessible thanks to advancements in technology. Social media plays an important role in this as it has given people a greater voice. However, it has also become easy for misinformation to be spread and it can be hard to determine which sources are reliable. I have developed a chatbot that can be used as a resource for the Black Lives Matter Movement. I was inspired by the blacklivesmatters.carrd.co. The goal was to create a user friendly way where people can become educated and also be proactive with signing petitions, texting/calling, donating and more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this chatbot is quite simple. The chatbot introduces itself and provides the user with several options. Depending on what the user would like to learn about, the chatbot will supply relevant information. It will reply to  'SIGN PETITIONS', 'CALL', 'DONATE', 'VOTE', 'LEARN' or 'MORE'. The chatbot will open new tabs full of information. 'QUIT' can be used to end the chatbot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If I had more time, I would have liked to learn how to scrape data from websites so that the chatbot will be continually up to date with current events. I would've like to also make the conversation flow more smoothly and feel like less of a robot.   "

    "Prior to attending UCSD, I had no programming experience and this left me feeling out of place as a CS major. This class has helped me develop a strong foundation in programming that I previously lacked and has challenged me to make my own projects. I'm so used to following the writeup for programming assignments so figuring out what to do with all of this freedom was hard. I took the time to find good resources for my chatbot to share and I believe there is alot of potential in my project if I keep working on it. "
